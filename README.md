# Crowd-Count-People-Counting-using-Video-Analytics
This project uses Python and deep learning–based object detection techniques to analyze video frames and estimate the number of people in a scene in real time or offline mode.

The system takes a video as input, breaks it into frames, detects human objects using a pre-trained deep learning model, and tracks each person across consecutive frames to avoid duplicate counting. The final output is the accurate count of people present, which is displayed on the video along with bounding boxes.

This project is useful in applications such as crowd management, surveillance, smart cities, public safety, malls, railway stations, and event monitoring.
